##

Vocabin converts raw text to flashcards with English translations, organised by difficulty and ready to import into flashcard applications like Anki.

Vocabin is live at http://vocabin.net

## Todo List for V1
- [x] Standardise all POS filters to only accept verbs, nouns, adverbs, interjections and adjectives across all languages.
- [x] Detect and filter non-words from text.
- [ ] Export vocabulary as Cloze cards with the sentence in which each word was found.
- [ ] Add Portuguese, Danish and Swahili.
- [ ] Change word frequency detector to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf" target="_blank">tfâ€“idf</a> instead of raw counts.

## Resources

Word frequency lists generated by the <a href="http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/" target="_blank">Leipzig Corpora</a> are used to group words by frequency.

The <a href="http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/" target="_blank">TreeTagger</a> library is used for POS-tagging.

## Running Locally

After cloning this repo and navigating to the project root, follow the steps below to set up the application on your local machine:

1. Run `npm install` in both the /client and /server directories.
2. Upload the word frequency data located in /word_freq_data to a local DB, with tables named `word_freq_{language}` and columns `word, freq, id`.
3. Obtain a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/" target="_blank">google translate API key</a>.
4. Install the <a href="http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/" target="_blank">TreeTagger</a> library, along with the parameter files for the supported languages.
5. Create a file `config/dev.json` of the following format:

```
{
  "googleTranslateApiKey": "{api key}",
  "cmdPath": "{Treetagger CMD directory path}",
  "mysqlCredentials": {
    "database": "{database name}",
    "username": "{username}",
    "password": "{password}",
    "host": "{host}"
  }
}
